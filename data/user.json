{"fullName":"Viktor Shevchenko","about":"Hi, my name is Viktor Shevchenko. I am a frontend developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I am 31, married, have a daughter.\n\nI have started my professional career in 2006 with a biggest telecom operator in Ukraine(Kyivstar) as a consultant and later as a mobile network engineer. In 2010 I have switched to fronted development area. Firstly as a freelancer, later as an employee.\n\nI have made my path from web developer to a team leader. Played a key role in project architecture development, built applications from scratch, transformed legacy applications to be SPA, managed a team up to 5 persons, adopted Scrum methodology.  \n\nPresently, I am a team lead in GlobalLogic Ukraine(IT outsourcing company, headquartered in USA). Beside my primary project duties I do participate in different internal activities like consulting on account launching, pre-sale activities, interviewing candidates, and mentoring JavaScript in training center.\n\nI am a kind of person, with a big desire to learn new information and share it, so I am always glad to accept challenges (both in my life, career and daily work). In software development I value quality over quantity. In technologies, I am using, I prefer to understand how they work on a low level, this helps me to use them with a maximum efficiency. I have solid knowledge of core and advanced Javascript, modern UI frameworks and related technologies.\n\nI do open source contribution by authoring and maintaning a library called [reactive-mobx-form](https://github.com/vict-shevchenko/reactive-mobx-form) that is aimed to simplify work with web forms in React MobX applications. And contributing to validation library [validatorjs](https://github.com/skaterdav85/validatorjs).\n\nBeside of programming I like traveling, active sports(snowboarding), mixing of cocktails.","skills":"### Web development:\n  __Code__:\tJavaScript (Object Oriented and Functional), ES6+, TypeScript, ReactJS, MobX, Redux, Angular, AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, PrototypeJS, D3.js, vis.js, Leaflet, MapBox, GoogleMaps, Lodash, MomentJS, AWS SDK.
